            CKD is diagnosed using two, simple, inexpensive laboratory tests: <span class="bold">estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate </span> and <span class="bold">Albumin-creatinine ratio</span>, urine. Both tests are necessary to have a clear picture of your kidney health.
          </p>
          <p>
            CKD has a silent onset, which means there are often no symptoms until the kidneys are badly damaged.  Kidney tests will tell you how your kidneys are working. You should find out as early as possible if you have kidney disease to avoid problems and slow the loss of kidney function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blood and urine tests show how well the kidneys are doing their job. Blood and urine tests reflect the level of function of the kidneys. Urine tests can show how well the kidneys remove body wastes and whether they are leaking too much protein.

                This test is the best measure of how well the kidneys are removing wastes and excess fluid from the blood. Your healthcare professional can estimate GFR (eGFR) from the blood creatinine level using your age, weight, gender, race and body size. Normal eGFR can vary according to age (as you get older it goes down).
              </p>
              <p>
                An eGFR below 60 is a sign that the kidneys are not working properly. An eGFR below 15 may mean that the person will need treatment for kidney failure, such as dialysis or a kidney transplant. You can think of eGFR as a percent of kidney function with less than 60% being lower than normal. The eGFR goes down if kidney disease gets worse.

                The urine albumin test or albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) is a test that measures the amount of protein called albumin in the urine. Albumin is found in high amounts in the blood, but almost no albumin is in the urine when the kidneys work well. However, kidney disease may cause albumin to spill (leak) into the urine, even early in the disease. An ACR more than 30  means that albumin has spilled into your urine because the kidneys are not working well.

            The kidneys filter your blood to remove wastes and excess fluid to make urine. They also help control blood pressure and make hormones that your body needs to stay healthy.

          <p>
            Chronic kidney disease means the kidneys have been damaged by diabetes, high blood pressure or other disorders. Damage to your kidneys can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease and kidney failure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chronic kidney disease has a silent onset, which means there are often no symptoms until the kidneys are damaged.  Kidney tests will tell you how your kidneys are working. If you are at risk, you should find out as early as possible if you have kidney disease to avoid problems and slow the loss of kidney function.
